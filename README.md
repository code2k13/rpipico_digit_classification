# Handwritten digit classification using Raspberry Pi Pico and ML

A project using Raspberry Pi Pico, an OV7670 camera module, a 120x160 TFT LCD display and machine learning to build a portable handwritten digit classification system. This code is highly experimental.  Even after you follow all the recommended steps in this article, some tinkering will still be necessary to get it to work.
